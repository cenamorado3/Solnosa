    <p>

        Hello everyone, <br />
        <br />
        My name is Christian Enamorado, I'm <a title="age = (DateTime.Now - Convert.ToDateTime(dob)).Days / 365;" data-toggle="tooltip" data-placement="top" href="#!">@Html.DisplayFor(model => model.BirthDate)</a> years old, I was born and raised in Miami, Florida
        and I am a first generation US immigrant from Honduras. <br />
        <br />
        Knowing at a young age I wanted to get into technology I decided to get started learning how to program from scratch. It all started sometime in 2004 when I first started writing LUA, making graphics, and working on websites for modded game communities.
        Eventually hosting my own locally on my little laptop for others to join and play on and continued doing so for several years with various games and communities, occasioanlly I still do! I knew I was passionate about it then and that maybe one day I would be able to make a career out of it.
        Fast forward nearly 20 years from the kid who just liked to play video games to today, after a few  hurdles and accidently falling into some pitholes it's needless to say, technology has thus far been a life long passion of mine that has stood the test of time and
        provided me a way to not only help myself but help those around me
        <br />
        <br />
        From developing personal relations with clients building computers and servers, setting up networks during the construction of office spaces, maintaining their networks and solving many technical issues.
        I've decided to settle into programming with the goal of moving into higher levels of software development and engineering and eventually I'd love to get into some form of penetration testing or ethical hacking.
        From developing my own frameworks with automation in mind, integrating external technologies and multiple languages in order to create real world solutions
        I've learned much in my life and continue to strive to learn more, it would not be rare to catch me surrounded with serveral programming books in pursuit of answers. After all, you can't google everything and somethings you have to figure out on your own.
        Whether it's how things work both on the Front-End and the Back-End, de-mystifying the space and time complexities of algortihims, manually sorting through binary trees to figure out how Data Structures work, writing a script to do my job for me, or using my website to interact with users and develop new skills,
        I know in the next 20 years I'll be much further along than I am today and look forward to the journey of both inheriting and passing knowledge over time, and with a bit of luck and hard work, anything is possible and all dreams start with a dreamer.
