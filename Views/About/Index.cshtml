<div class="About">
    <p>
        Hello everyone, <br />
        <br />
        My name is Christian Enamorado, I'm @Html.DisplayFor(model => model.BirthDate) years old, I was born and raised in Miami, Florida and I am a first generation US Immigrant my roots being from Honduras. <br />
        <br />
        Knowing at a young age I wanted to get into technology I decided to get started learning how to program from scratch. It all started in 2004 with the release of World of Warcraft. Unable to play to the
        retail versions of the game, I took matters into my own hands and ventured into private servers, after some time I learned I could host my own and began working with others hosting servers, eventually
        hosting and writing scripts for my own server and continued doing so for several years with various games and communities. After years of doing this I knew I wanted to get into Programming as a career
        and started developing my technical skills both professionally and casually. Fast forward nearly 20 years from the kid who just liked to play video games to today.
        <br />
        <br />
        From developing personal relations with clients building computers and servers, setting up networks during construction of offices, maintaining their networks and solving many technical issues.
        I've decided to settle into programming with the end goal of moving into higher levels of software development and engineering. From developing my own frameworks with Automation in mind with the knowledge
        I've gained in my recent expereinces, integrating external technologies and multiple languages in order to create real world solutions I've learned much in my life and continue to strive to learn more, it
        would not be rare to catch me surrounded with serveral Programming books in pursuit of answers to how things work both on the Front-End and the Back-End, whether de-mystifying the Space and Time complexities
        of complex algortihims, sorting through binary trees to figure out how Data Structures work, writing a script to do my job for me, or using my website to interact with users, I know in the next 20 years I'll be
        much farther along than I am today and look forward to the journeys of both inheriting and passing of knowledge in time.
        <br />
